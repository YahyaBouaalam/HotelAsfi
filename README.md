Management software for Hotel Asfi

## About this Project:

This repository contains my first ever software project, a desktop business management software of a fictional hotel from my imagination, built with Java and SwingUI. This personal project represents my very first outlook on Object-oriented programming and software development principles. Despite the end-product not being that great, I consider this project to be my first stepping stone into the world of software development, as I later went on to learn more modern and specialized frameworks for software development.

## Technologies used:
  - Languages Used: Java
  - UI: Swing Toolkit.
  - Data Handling: Java I/O streams with CSV file handling, As I still hadn't learned SQL (or any database technology) yet at the time.
